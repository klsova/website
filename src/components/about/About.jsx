        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>I am a third-year Information Technology student, an active student organization member, and the Chairperson of Digit ry. I have experience in such skills as team coordination, event planning, budgetary responsibility and broad communication skills.</p>
        <p>I have skills in Python, Java, JavaScript with a base knowledge in React and Express based applications. I also have skills in Photoshop and other artistic skills as well basic understanding of economics and business through my minor studies.</p>
        <p>My guildmates see me as an happy and active team player who succeeds under guidance, but equally capable of taking the initiative as I become familiar with tasks and responsibilities.</p>
        <p>In my freetime I enjoy running, videogames, television shows and programming of course. I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning something new, which is probably where my love and passion from coding stems from.</p>

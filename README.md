# My portfolio website

This is will probably always be a WIP as I am planning to implement more things as I learn them.

Utilizes React and React Router. Made with JS, HTML and CSS.

 ~~The website is currently deployed through Azure as a static web app.~~ The website is currently deployed through Vercel.

# TODO:
 
 - Implement a contact me section which would reroute messages through a backend (possibly Express-based) to a database.
 - Make an API call system that would send notifications to my email that I have received a new message.
 - Add a captcha or some sort of security question so that it cannot be spammed.

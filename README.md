# My portfolio website

This is wil probably always be a WIP as I am planning to implement more things as I learn them.

The website is currently deployed through Azure as a static web app.

You can visit the webiste through this link: [kallesova.fi](https://black-field-0055f0303.5.azurestaticapps.net/)

# TODO:
 
 - Deploy the site as proper web app and not a static web app, so that I can run my own backend technology.
 - Implement a contact me section which would reroute messages through a backend (possibly Express-based) to a database.
 - Make an API call system that would send notifications to my email that I have received a new message.
 - Add a not a robot or some sort of security question so that it cannot be spammed.
